# Merops-Crawler

## Brief Introduction

This python crawler project basically snatches data from the bulletin board of the NTU CSIE website, and saves them as .csv files accordingly. The information that is crawled from the internet can be specified by the user by entering the start date, end date, and output filename. All spaces and newlines in the text will be removed to make the data more readable. Moreover, strings are enclosed by pairs of double quotation marks, while any double quote within the string will be replaced by 2 double quotation marks.
